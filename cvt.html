					My life is heading in direction of connecting humans and computers to cooperate in a best way possible and I am always looking for new ways to improve what already exists. \
					My interest in technology and science began when I was 10, tinkering with old radios and tape recorders, then it elevated when I got interested in music, which is, nowadays, just computers and signal processing after all. So I continued that and I decided to look more into coding, My first project ever was a simple server status tool, and it was in C#. After that I was forced to go in C/C++ direction, designed FFT algorithm in Java and I was always playing around looking for fun stuff to discover. \
					Later, mostly out of most accessible projects I switched over to JavaScript/TypeScript/ReactJs/Redux combo and worked as frontend engineer, with occasional overlap with cybersecurity features like making sure that our VPN and DNS are secure enough, since there was next to none security inside the network(customer's requirement). \
					Also this CV was written as SPA in VanillaJS, so feel free to look at the code, I will be flattered. \
