 of connecting humans and computers to cooperate in a best way possible
 and I am always looking for new ways to improve what already exists. \
 My interest in technology and science began when I was 10, tinkering
 with old radios and tape recorders, then it elevated when I got
 interested in music, which is, nowadays, just computers and signal
 processing after all. So I continued that and I decided to look more
 into coding, My first project ever was a simple server status tool, and
 it was in C#. After that I was forced to go in C/C++ direction,
 designed FFT algorithm in Java and I was always playing around looking
 for fun stuff to discover. \ Later, mostly out of most accessible
 projects I switched over to JavaScript/TypeScript/ReactJs/Redux combo
 and worked as frontend engineer, with occasional overlap with
 cybersecurity features like making sure that our VPN and DNS are secure
 enough, since there was next to none security inside the
 network(customer's requirement). \ Also this CV was written as SPA in
 VanillaJS, so feel free to look at the code, I will be flattered. \ `
