					I am fullstack developer with overlaps to many areas, including automation, cybersecurity, embedded systems and anything that catches my interest. \
	       				This comes from fascination with electrical engineering since I was 10 and it hasn't left so far. \
	       				I am experienced python and JS developer, since it is most comfortable to use this combination for rapid and agile development. \
	       				Learning that good DevOps is a critical part of any teamwork was one of the most imporant lessons I got as engineer. \
	       				Also it is important to me to have good relationship with team and colleagues even from other department close to me, either project wise or near my office. \
	       				I have also peaked into the world of cybersecurity and after a year i still have to call myself a beginner, since I am just learning how many things I don't know, therefore being humble is in place regarding this matter. \
	       				For whatever reason I became heavy VIM user, probably because of it's availibility on pretty much every *nix based computer. \
					This CV was written as SPA in VanillaJS, it will be my pleasure if you check it out! \
